The solution involved identifying a conflicting CSS rule in a parent component that was overriding the Tailwind classes. I added a more specific selector in my stylesheet to override the conflicting rule and ensure the Tailwind classes were applied correctly.  I also verified there weren't any conflicting class names or typographical errors in the class names themselves.  The solution made the class application consistent across components and browsers.
