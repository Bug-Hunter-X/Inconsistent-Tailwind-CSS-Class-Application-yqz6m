I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The HTML structure seemed fine, and the classes were correctly imported into my CSS.  The problem only occurred on certain components and was inconsistent across different browsers.  Debugging proved difficult as the browser's developer tools didn't show any obvious errors.
