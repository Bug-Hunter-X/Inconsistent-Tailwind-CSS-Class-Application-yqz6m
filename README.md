# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are applied inconsistently across different components and browsers.  The issue is not immediately apparent in the browser's developer tools.  The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a solution.

## Bug

The core issue involves unexpected class precedence or conflicting styles leading to inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully inspecting the CSS cascade, using more specific selectors, and ensuring that class names don't conflict. The solution may involve adding !important to certain styles, but that is not a recommended approach.
